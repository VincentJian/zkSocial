ZK Social
=========

This project uses ZK to build a Facebook-like social platform. In this project, a few new features
introduced in ZK 6.5 are utilized to produce UI interactions specific to touch-capable devices.

Please look at this [blog post](http://blog.zkoss.org/index.php/2012/08/14/zk-6-5-tablet-ui-design/) 
for more information about the demo app.
